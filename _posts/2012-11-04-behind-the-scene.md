I've always found that the most interesting part of our job as Web Developers was to
turn an idea into a real and usable feature.

This process is also very mysterious for our users, Black Magic of which we, Developers,
are the grand priests.

In the following article, i would like to focus on a real example of how Software is built.
The feature itself won't be discussed in too much details and I won't talk about requirement's
analysis methodologies or arcane design processes. Instead, I will try and give an honest step by step
lifecycle of how a feature is really shipped.

## What are we building?

## Step 2: Documenting our Prototype.

## Step 3: Testing and Refactoring.

## Step 4: Implementing as a User-Facing Feature.

## Step 5: Launching, Maintaining & Evolving.
